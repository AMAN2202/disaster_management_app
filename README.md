# disaster_management_app

* A web and app-based community application for local communities to utilize communication technology to better respond to emergencies (in particular natural disasters).
*  Alerts are sent out to community members during emergencies through SMS, mobile app alerts and telephone response systems that allow community members to easily provide responses that advise on their safety status and actions plans.
*    Map showing disaster level and safe zones that are regions that heavily affected so that local communities can help them out. All the data will be collected from the user that belongs to the affected region which will improve accuracy.
*    The map will also point out an individual that is in immediate need of help so that nearby people can help him.
*    A community administrator can easily see the current status of hundreds of community members from a monitoring console and offer assistance or alert emergency services where the responses require it (or if there is no response at all).
*    The system will assist the roles of the emergency services and allow for effective community action and mobility when the time is of the essence.
